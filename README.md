Influenced

Influenced is a simple CLI social media app where influencers are invited to the platform. This means that influencers are seperate accounts from follower accounts. In terms of functionality this restricts influencers from being able to follow, and restricts followers from being able to post. Although this is true, followers can interact with posts through reactions (like, congratulate, confused) and follow influencers to get updates and show their appreciation.

Since this is a CLI app it can save any information, and is just for practice/fun.

Note: This was made so I can practice Object Oriented Design and Object Associations.
